    "\n",
    "In this project, we use Python's `configparser` library to manage configuration settings, such as file paths, in an external `.ini` file. This approach has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**: By keeping configuration data (like file paths) outside of the code, to modify the settings without changing the main script. And keep the code clean and reduce the risk of hardcoding sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security**: Sensitive information, such as file paths or credentials, can be stored in a separate file (e.g., `config.ini`) and excluded from version control using `.gitignore`. To ensures sensitive data is not accidentally shared or exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: If the file paths or other configurations need to change (e.g., between environments like development and production), only update the `.ini`  no need to modify the core code."

The Park is divided into two distinct areas: a) Timbebas reefs and b) Abrolhos Archipelago and Parcel dos Abrolhos. They include a mosaic of marine and coastal environments such as coral reefs, algae bottoms, mangroves, beaches and sandbanks. The site sustains IUCN-Red List critically endangered species such as Leatherback Sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) and Hawkbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), as well as other endangered and vulnerable species, including Loggerhead Sea turtle (Caretta caretta), Green turtle (Chelonia Myda), Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and many threatened fish species such as the Groupers and the coral (Millepora nitida). The area is considered an archeological site due to the number of wrecks found on its waters. It provides livelihood for more than 20,000 fishermen and 80,000 tourism-related posts in the Bahia State area. The threats within the park include illegal fishing, the great number of tourists which causes stress on the bird and coral population and increased litter; and pollution from ship ballast cleaning activities. Research and tourist facilities and activities include a visitors' center inaugurated in 2004, the Research and Monitoring Center of Abrolhos, a voluntary internship program for undergraduate students, and a consultant council composed of different stakeholders in the community.

An extensive site characterized by periodically and permanently flooded grasslands, unique in the Amazon region, as well as by its mangroves, which act as “fish nurseries” and are vital for the maintenance of some of Brazil´s most important fisheries. The site is rich in biodiversity and supports globally threatened species such as the Black Bearded Saki (Chiropotes satanas), the Great Billed Seed Finch (Sporophila maximiliani), the yellow spotted River Turtle (Podocnemis unifilis) and the Black Caiman (Melanosuchus niger) among others. To date, 358 species of birds, 19 species of plants, 54 species of mammals have been identified in the park. Apart from its biodiversity and water resources, the associated marine and estuarine fisheries production is essential for the economy of Brazil, which has made the area one of the most intensively fished areas in the region with overfishing and illegal fishing constituting the main threat to the site. Other threats include the spread of the invasive species of shrimp Macrobrachium rosembergii, overexploitation of two species of turtles (Podocnemis unifilis and Podocnemis expansa), and forest fires.

Located on the Pacific coast near the border with Colombia, between the rivers Cayapas and Mataje, the site is a complex of estuaries and mangrove forests within the Choco-Darien-Western Ecuador hotspot, a region recognized worldwide for its high level of biodiversity, numerous endemic species, and priority for conservation. Sedge marshes, tidal brackish marshes, peatlands or guandales, as well as humid tropical forest add to its richness. The high productivity of phytoplankton and mangrove forests sustains a diverse wildlife, with reportedly 6 species of mangrove, 68 of fish, 22 of reptiles, 145 of birds and 53 of mammals, including several threatened taxa at national or global scale, such as the black mangrove Avicennia germinans, the Neotropical Otter Lutra longicaudis, the Jaguar Panthera onca, the Blue-fronted Parrotlet Touit dilectissima and the American Crocodile Crocodylus acutus. The Afro-Ecuadorian population at the site is involved in fishing, gathering of mussels and crustaceans, subsistence agriculture and livestock raising, and recently, ecotourism. Archaeological remains of the Tolita culture (ca. 500 BC-AD 400) are abundant. The area has been affected by the construction of numerous shrimp pools and the establishment of crop plantations. Following designation as a Nature Reserve in 1996, a management plan is in preparation with local involvement. WWF International's Living Waters Programme and the Fundación Natura assisted Ecuador in making this designation. Ramsar site No. 1292. Most recent RIS information: 2003.</td>\n",

One of the few sites in Ecuador that protects healthy mountain ecosystems (paramo, bogs, lagoons and forests), it plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of the region, since it is the source of several rivers that benefit directly human populations. The threatened fauna species that can be found in the site include Ecuadorian grass mouse (Akodon latebricola), the andean ondor (Vultur gryphus), the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus), and some regional herpetofauna, like Centrolene buckleyi, Gastrotheca espeletia, Eleutherodactylus ocreatus, Eleutherodactylus grp. Devillei, and Riama simoterus. Due to its location on the high occidental Andean mountain range (at 3,200-4,200m altitude) and the north occidental zone of Ecuador, it is a strategic area for the linkage of two biodiversity hotspots (Hotspot Tropical Andes and Hotspot Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena), and it is thus also an important site for neotropical bird conservation. All the biodiversity supported by the site is pressured by the advance of agricultural frontiers, burning, hunting, fishing, climate and hydrological changes. Ramsar Site no. 2085.

A marine-coastal wetland on the Caribbean coast characterized by broad-leaf forest, swamps, and mangrove forest. The areas adjacent to the lagoons are dominated by mangroves, characterized by red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), white mangrove (Languncularia racemosa), and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus). The site's rich fauna includes endangered species like the Caribbean manatee (Trichechus manatus), uncommon birds such as the jabirú (Jabiru mycteria) and fish characteristic to this type of ecosystem, including schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus) and horse-eye jack (Caranx latus). The site is invaluable in providing flood control, sedimentation capture, and stabilization of the reflux between the sea and the lagoon, which is fed by the Sico Tinto o Negro river. Economic activity by small populations in the area, including agriculture, deforestation and illegal fishing remain as threats. However, government and non-governmental organizations remain active in promoting sustainable fishing practices and appropriate micro-basin management.

Located in northern Tierra del Fuego Island, Ramsar's second southernmost site lies on the border with Argentina and faces the Magellan Strait. It features the largest intertidal flats in Chile, fronting a 69 km long beach and several salt marshes. The bay is renowned for its high concentrations of migratory shorebirds from October to March, with records of more than 41,000 Red Knots Calidris canutus, over 88% of the population in the Americas; 4,500 Hudsonian Godwits Limosa haemastica, 23% of the global population; 12,000 White-rumped Sandpipers Calidris fuscicollis, 3% of global population, as well as near threatened species such as the Magellanic Plover Pluvianellus socialis and the Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis. Precipitation is scarce and vegetation is typical of the Patagonian steppe, dominated by the grasses Festuca pallescens and F. gracillima. Large cetaceans have frequently stranded in the flats, with 21 species recorded. Human population is very scarce and sheep grazing is the main activity, as well as oil extraction from two platforms within the flats. The impact of pollution from oil spills from large vessels as well as from the platforms is a concern, but fortunately there is large recirculation of water thanks to the prevailing currents.

The site is one of the few relatively undisturbed natural areas in the Chaco, hosting an impressive biodiversity, including the endangered Chacoan Peccary Catagonus wagneri and the Brazilian Tapir Tapirus terrestris. Several wintering shorebird species are abundant, with up to 25,000 Wilson's Phalaropes Phalaropus tricolor, 4,000 White Rumped Sandpipers Calidris fuscicollis, and 3,000 Pectoral Sandpipers Calidris melanotos, all of them figures above 1% threshold. The same is true for the Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis, which are regular on the site. Chaco Lodge is entirely devoted to conservation and small scale ecotourism, and hunting and cattle ranching pressures from the surrounding area are very limited. The greatest threat, however, comes from the intense drought affecting the region the past few years. The site designation was carried out with support of the NGO Fundación DeSdelChaco.

An alluvial plain along the Pilcomayo River which is flooded much of the year and characterized by patches of forest, extensive, clustered lakes, and savannas of palm groves. Watercourses follow ancient riverbeds, with gallery forest growing alongside. Another sector is composed of vast, dry plains of grasses and shrubs. Located in the tropical deciduous dry forest biogeographical region, the site, in outstanding condition, is a good representative of biodiversity. Situated along the migration route, birds are abundant in species and number. Several threatened wildlife species (rhea, caiman, turtle, and jaguar) and fish species breed here. The site is important for Potamogeton striatus, a critically endangered plant, and supports a distinct mammalian fauna. Extensive ranching, extraction of forest products, and poaching occur.

Situated at an altitude of 3,020 meters, this High-Andean wetland comprises four permanent and one temporary lagoons, two swamps and two rivers, and is part of the Pikillaqta Arqueological Park and the National Tourist Reserve. This wetland provides considerable food and refuge to various threatened (Falco femoralis, Falco peregrinus, Jabiru mycteria) and endemic (Oreonympha nobilis, Asthenes ottonis, Poospiza caesar) avian species, making it possible to identify over 70 such species throughout the year. Among the most representative flora are various species of cacti and the \"Algarrobo\" tree (Prosopis laevigata), which at 3,100 meters AMSL probably has the highest altitude of its distribution in South America. The overexploitation of resources constitutes an important threat to the site, which is in turn facilitated by uncertainty about the ownership of the land. Ramsar Site No. 1627.

The greater part of the wetlands comprise creeks (1,800ha) and streams while the remainder is mangroves (1,172ha). The inclusion of Manglares de Tumbes in the Ramsar List is a very important step forward in the conservation of mangroves, not only because it is at the southernmost limit of this type of wetland on the Pacific coast of South America, but also because of the ever-increasing rate of mangrove destruction for shrimp and fish farming. The area is important for the population of the vulnerable American crocodile and otter, both endangered in Peru. Waterfowl are also important in this area, as there are a number of species which do not occur elsewhere in the country. The wetland serves as a source of food for the local communities roundabout.

Located in the lower stretch of the Uruguay River, downstream from the Salto Grande Dam on the border with Argentina, the site consists of alluvial areas on the river's eastern bank as well as 24 islands, flooded during surges and exposed at low water levels. The system is important for the control of floods and erosion of the river banks. Elevated sand bars along the islands and alluvial plain are populated with forests and allow permanent and intermittent freshwater pools to be present in this dynamic environment. There are records of the near threatened Maned Wolf Chrysocyon brachyurus, as well as of several endangered birds: the Saffron-cowled Blackbird, Xanthopsar flavus, and the Seedeaters Sporophila cinnamomea, S. palustris and S. zelichi, the latter critically endangered. The larger part of the area is owned by the State, and its most abundant use is extensive cattle grazing in the summer, although there is coal, horticulture and citrus production as well. The principal problem affecting the site is soil erosion due to bad agricultural practices in adjacent areas. Ramsar site no. 1433.Most recent RIS information: 2004.</td>\n",

The Parana River is one of the largest and more diverse in the world, the second in South America after the Amazon. An extensive complex of rivers, lagoons, pools, permanent freshwater marshes and seasonally inundated grassland, interspersed with riparian woodland and gallery forest, makes this site one of paramount importance from the biodiversity and hydrological point of view in Argentina. The site provides habitat for a large number of species, some vulnerable or threatened with extinction, such as Lontra longicaudis, Tamandua tetradactyla, Chrysocyon brachyurus, Caiman yacare, C. latirostris, Eunectes notaeus, Tupinambis merianae, Boiruna maculata, and Hydrops triangularis. Ther is an important population of ducks, including Netta peposaca, Dendrocygna bicolor and D. viduata, and migratory birds such as Calidris melanotos, C. fuscicollis, C. bairdii, Tringa melanoleuca, T. flavipes, T. solitaria and Limosa haemastica are also found. There is a very rich aquatic life, with about 300 fish species, which are key for the regional economy, as 50% of the population in the area live by fishing. Sport fishing and ecotourism are important economic activities as well. Ramsar site no. 1112. Most recent RIS information: 2001.</td>\n",

The site consists of two subsites located in the northwest of Argentina, between 3,010m and 6,885m a.s.l., and includes a complex of high Andean endorheic river basins representative of the Central Dry Puna: shallow meso- and hypersaline lakes, shallow and deep brackish lakes, and deep hypersaline lakes. 19,000 individuals of Puna flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi) and 2,100 of Andean flamingo (P. andinus) gather in this site, which represents 18% and 6% of the worldwide population of these species, respectively. The site also hosts several endemic species of the High Andean Puna, such as the Giant Coot (Fulica gigantean), Andean Avocet (Recurvirostra andina), Crested Duck (Anas specularioides alticola), Vicuña (Vicugna vicugna), Andean Fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and a frog species endemic to the Catamarca region (Telmatobius hauthali). In addition, IUCN Red List threatened species Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita) and short-tailed chinchilla (Chinchilla brevicaudata) occur in the area, as well as 14 migratory species (e.g. Calidris melanotos, C. bairdii, and Tringa flavipes). This High Andean wetland is a highly vulnerable and fragile ecosystem and is threatened by overgrazing, unregulated tourism, mining prospecting and flamingo egg collection. The area is one of the 14 priority sites of the Wetland Network of Importance for Conservation of High-Andes Flamingos in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru.

A long system of linked lagoons and marshes fed by the Mendoza and San Juan Rivers in the provinces of those names. The system drains into the Desaguadero River and covers an area of some 10,000 square km. The dominant wetland type is \"seasonal/intermittent freshwater lakes\", but the site also includes \"seasonal/intermittent/irregular rivers/streams/creeks\", \"seasonal/intermittent/ freshwater marshes/pools\", \"shrub-dominated wetlands\", and some other less frequent wetland types. There is a rich biodiversity associated with the system, with more than 50 species of waterbirds. The system has suffered a number of natural and anthropogenic alterations which have considerably reduced the area covered by the lagoons and marshes. A rehabilitation program is being implemented. The local communities include some 2000 people, known as the \"laguneros\", whose customs and traditions are based in the lagoons and their resources. The provincial governments of Mendoza and San Juan are cooperating closely in the site designation and management. In 1999, the Ramsar/US Government Wetlands for the Future Initiative financed a First Training Workshop for the Local Community and Intermediate Institutions for the Rehabilitation and Management of the Lagunas de Guanacache. The designation of the Lagunas as a Ramsar site is a further step in the efforts to rehabilitate and conserve the system. The site was significantly extended from 580,000 to 962,370 hectares in 2007.

It holds special value for one or more endemic species or communities of flora and fauna in each of seven protected areas and contains 1,131 species of flora, 884 of them of potential ornamental use. It contains populations of endemic bromelia Pitcairnia funckiae and sustains threatened and endangered species of fauna, such as the mammals Tapirus bairdii (Baird's tapir) and Leopardus pardalis (ocelot), and birds such as Cephalopterus glabricollis and the Amazilia boucardi hummingbird. The wetland provides benefits related to hydropower generation, irrigation, tourism (water sports), recreational fishing and consumption, grazing, domestic agriculture and irrigation, agriculture and aquaculture. A management plan was implemented in 1997. Approximately 80% of the existing legislation is being enforced to regulate activities in the wetland and other protected areas.

A unique high mountain wetland (altitude 700-3821m) located in the Talamanca mountain range and considered an extremely heterogeneous area in terms of the ecosystems present: non-forested peatlands, paramos, meadows, cloud forests, and rain forests. The protected areas comprising the Ramsar site make up an immense biological corridor that allows numerous vulnerable animal species to move about in search of food and breeding sites, among them the Central American tapir Tapirus bairdii, the ocelot Felis pardales, and the red brocket Mazama americana. Numerous plant communities are present in the site's different ecosystems present - paramos, oak forests, and non-forested peatlands. Paramos are found between 2900-3100 meters above sea level, and contain a unique mixture of neotropical flora, including holartic, Andean, and endemic species, which show important adaptations to extreme conditions, seasonality, and high solar radiation. Oaks are the dominant feature in what is regarded as the country's largest forest mass, most notably the IUCN Red-Listed black oak Quercus costaricencis and the hook Quercus corrugata. Peatlands are \"drowned\" and thus are characterized by Ciperaceae, Juncaceae, Ericaceae, large ferns of the Blechnaceae family, plus Sphagnum and other mosses. The hydrological network in Tapantí National Park is of vital importance for Costa Rica in terms of hydroelectric power production and supply of a large portion of the drinking water for the country's largest cities. Chirripó National Park features the country's tallest mountain, Cerro Chirripó (3820m above sea level), as well as rare geomorphologic formations of glacial origin. The largest indigenous group in Costa Rica, the Bribri, are native to the mountains of Talamanca, thus giving the site a great cultural importance. Ramsar site no. 1286.

A freshwater wetland located in the confluence of the rivers Carrizal and Chone, consisting of a central marsh that is flooded most of the time and an extensive plain that is inundated in the rainy season. Its soils are loam sandy, silt and/or clay-silt, deep with recent fine fluvial sediment deposits. The water is of medium quality, with presence of fecal coliforms and total solids, with a low percentage of dissolved oxygen. The wetland has a low diversity of organisms, but a high density of 12 species of fish, two species of river shrimp, turtles of the genus Chelydra and 164 species of birds (22 migratory species and 63 aquatic ones). 27 families and 39 species of wild vegetation represent the flora. During the rainy season, the aquatic plants are dominant, especially \"the lechuguines\" (Eichhornia crassipes, water hyacinth); the depth of the marsh can reach an average of 1.27 m. During the dry season, the flooded plain is full of grasses and sedges and the water body is reduced to approximately 525 hectares, with an average depth of 67 cm. Four towns are located around the marsh with an estimated population of 1700 people, and the main land uses within the wetland are fishing, ranching and agriculture.

This High Andean site is located in Chile\u0019s central zone on the Andes mountain range between 2500 and above 5000 m altitude. It comprises a hydric network counting rivers, streams, glaciers, Andean vegas, and underground springs. The area has extreme climatologic conditions characterized by intense cold, snow, drought and high radiation. These environmental conditions confer the site high ecological value because it supports an important group of fauna and flora including endemic species such as the small-tailed snake (Tachymenis chilensis) as well as endangered species such as the matuasto (Phymaturus flagellifer), a large number of migratory birds and higher vertebrates. The ecosystem in the Ramsar Site Juncal Andean Park is representative of the Mediterranean shrubland region; unique in South America and considered an endangered ecosystem by World Bank and WWF. Among its main threats are: extensive livestock rearing, mining and industrial development. The Juncal Andean Park lies within the \u001cMineral Cordillera\u001d private area, where its main land uses are recreation, education and scientific research. Ramsar site no. 1909.

Located in the catchment area of Salar de Atacama, this site is characteristic for presenting a crust of different types of salts, mainly chlorides and sulphates. There is also a hydrological system conformed by a series of superficial channels and lagoons, that together constitute a perfect habitat for waterfowl, many of which are endangered such as the three High Andean flamingo species Phoenicopterus chilensis, Phoenicoparrus jamesi y Phoenicoparrus andinus. This last species is found in the Barros Negros, Chxas and Puilar Lagoons of this site, being their most important reproductive center in the World. These lagoons also represent an important area for resting for inter-hemispheric waterfowl in their migration, such as the species Calidris bairdii, Steganopus tricolor, among others. Sistema Hidrológico de Soncor is located in the National Reserve Los Flamencos, and the main land use focuses in the conservation of natural resources, the public use and recreation in natural spaces. Among the negative impacts that affect this area are the following: uncontrolled tourism, use of underground water for the production of non-metallic mining activities, and the extraction of flamingo eggs. The site is included in the Participative Management Plan of the National Reserve Los Flamencos, and falls under the Management Category IV of IUCN (Habitat/Species Management Area).

Located in the Honduran Gulf on the Caribbean coast, the site includes a) marine; b) marshes and swamps; c) coastal; and d) terrestrial ecosystems. The marine area is shallow with a sandy bottom and a few patches of corals; the main vegetation here is Tallasia. The marshes and swamps serve as refuge for many species such as manatees (Trichechus manatus). The swamp is characterized by detritus and peat which have been transported by the Motagua River, the largest of Guatemala. The main plant communities are Chrysobalanus icaco, Symphonia globulifera, Phragmites comunis and Manicaria. There are several threatened and vulnerable mammal species such as Allouatta palliatta; Tapirus baiirdii, Tayassu tajacu, Tayassu pecari and Panthera onca are also found in the area, as are Crocodylus acutus and Iguana iguana. Expansion of the grazing areas, use of pesticides and fertilizers, and development of tourist resorts present some threat. Access to the area is difficult, and the main economic activity, although restricted to a very small area, is fishing in shallow waters. Hunting of wildlife such as iguanas is also important, as well as grazing and rice plantations in the borders of the wetland. The management plan for the area is being prepared by FUNDARY (Fundación Mario Dary) with the support of CONAP (El Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas).

It is the country's only inland wetland in the coastal mountains, at 350m altitude, and supports a singular biotic community characteristic of both the Chaco and the Andes. The site is located in a large dale surrounded by hills of natural and seminatural landscape, with open, lightly wooded fields in the lower parts and more and less dense woodlands higher up. Small areas of subsistence pasturage and agriculture are found around the lake. Some 23 species of mammals, 40 of birds, and 11 of reptiles are found there, and three of its vertebrate species are found in the CITES Appendix II. An important group of settlements along the shores have taken the decision to manage the wetland in such a way as to ensure its conservation, and the lake is part of the Ecological Reserve Mache-Chindul.

The island is an undeveloped area of extraordinary importance for the conservation of waterbirds and constitutes a major refuge for the marine biodiversity of the continental coast of the country, for which reason it was inscribed as a Protected Area of Natural Heritage in 1999. Its outstanding feature is the large-scale presence of avifauna, 23,000 individuals of the species Fragatas or Frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and Blue-footed Booby Sula nebouxi. The site holds exceptional social and cultural value and is considered from archaeological artifacts to be an early refuge of the first inhabitants of the larger Isla Puná, and a point of reference for navigators since the prehistoric era. It provides a unique opportunity for scientific investigations of marine-terrestrial ecosystems. Artisanal and industrial fishing are supported in the area.

The southernmost Ramsar site in the world at the time of designation, located in Tierra del Fuego Province at an altitude between 200 and 1300 m, covers glaciers; lakes; Sphagnum-, Cyperacea-, and tree-dominated peatlands; Nothofagus (Southern beech) forests; and permanent and seasonal rivers. Among the flora, Skottsbergia paradoxa, an endemic and threatened moss species, stands out. The glaciers and peatlands, excellent natural water reservoirs, play an important role in the \u001cArroyo Grande\u001d watershed regulation, a river that is the primary water source of the city of Ushuaia. The presence of the Vinciguerra glacier and the Andorra valley's peatlands contribute to the scenic beauty of the site, which attracts local and foreign tourists. The threats to this site are horse rearing (animals feed on Nothofagus sprouts), tree cutting for domestic use and, to a lesser extent, peat extraction. Additionally, climate change affects Vinciguerra glacier stability. The site acts as a buffer area between the Tierra del Fuego National Park and the suburban expansion of Ushuaia.

Located in the border area between the Pampa and Espinal ecoregions, this site contains characteristic communities and habitats of both areas. Palmar Yatay provides support to animal species such as Falco Peregrinus (Appendix I of CITES), as well as species of 4 endemic fish families and 10 endemic plant species. It also sustains a significant proportion of native fish species like Dorado (Salminus brasiliensis) and wolf fish (Hoplias malabaricus).

A naturally created coastal wetland area with mangrove forests, a seagrass bed, and a shallow nearshore coral reef, which includes a 12-acre artificially-created lake that constitutes the largest body of inland water on the island. At least 84 bird species have been recorded, including Caribbean coot (Fulica caribaea) and Yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), and the site's Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) stands are the largest healthy mangrove areas left on the island. There are more than 20 fresh and brackish water fish species, among the most interesting of which are those marine species that have become isolated from the sea and become breeding residents of the lake. Fishing has been suspended pending study of the effect of the water quality for human consumption of fish and the effects on fish populations of the introduction of aggressive tilapia species. Ecotourism and environmental educational and research activities are the chief human uses of the site, which has been proposed as a National Heritage Site. Ramsar site no. 1591.

Located at altitudes between 2500-4500m above sea level, Laguna Brava includes a system of saline and hyper-saline shallow lagoons. Characteristic high-Andean communities of bofedales (wet-marshy meadows) are found above 3000m. The Reserve is host to a rich biodiversity associated to the wetland, with abundant summer populations of endemic waterfowl, including James' and Andean flamingos (Phoenicoparrus jamesi and P. andinus). The site also has special recognition as a Reserve for Camelids, most notably vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) and guanaco (Lama Guanicoe). Historically, the region was utilized by the Incas as an important enclave for domination of local populations and as a natural Andean transit point to Chile. Currently, it is precisely the development of an international road, plus the possibility of mineral prospecting, which could potentially affect the site. Recent management and zoning measures are to be strengthened to insure the proper long-term conservation of the site. Ramsar site No. 1238. Most recent RIS information: 2003.</td>\n",

Seasonally and permanently flooded forests predominate, with some 1,100 hectares of lowland sphagnum moss bog unique to the region, a saline/brackish inland lagoon, and 9,600 ha of saline swamps, with the country's most undisturbed and largest stand of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and its only stands of Comfra Palm (Manicaria saccifera). Several threatened and vulnerable species are supported, such as Black Howler Monkey, the Hickatee Turtle, the tapir Tapirus bairdii, the West Indian Manatee, and Morelett's Crocodile. The buffer zone of the park is home to the indigenous Kekchi Maya and Garifuna people, both of which attach high cultural importance to parts of the site. Stands of mahogany, cedar, and rosewood are targets for illegal crossborder logging efforts.

Situated in the endorrheic Tajzara basin, 45 kilometres west of the city of Tarija, at 3,700m above sea level, the site consists of a group of seasonal, semi-permanent and permanent lakes, high-altitude streams, marshes and high-Andean pastures. The two permanent lakes (areas between 350 and 800 ha) serve as a refuge for 40 species of birds indigenous to the high-Andean aquatic systems, where about 90% of the high-Andean waterfowl in Bolivia is found. The area is important for migratory shore birds, with year-round concentrations of the vulnerable high-Andean waterfowl species Andean flamingo (Phoenicopterus andinus), James's flamingo (P. jamesi), and Fulica cornuta. More than 30 archaeological sites have been identified near the lakes, ranging from vestiges of primitive hunter-gatherers, pre-Incan hydraulic constructions, cave paintings illustrating aquatic birds, and three Incan roads that lead from the basin to the valley. The main economic activity is the raising of sheep, llamas and cattle; agriculture is limited by the climate, though the families in the area have an average of ½ to 1 hectare for subsistence crops. There is a visitors' centre, a bird-observation site, information material, and facilities for school visits. There are plans to draw up a management plan with the participation of the local communities. The site forms part of the Reserva Biológica de la Cordillera de Sama, which is managed by the Servicio Nacional de Areas Protegidas through the NGO Protección del Medio Ambiente Tarija (PROMETA).

The site, first designated in 1990 as \u001cLaguna Colorada\u001d, is located in the Bolivian Altiplano between 4,200 and 6,000m altitude \u0013 the area covered was significantly extended as of 13 July 2009 from 51,318 to 1,427,717 hectares and now includes a complex of high Andean endorheic permanent saline, hypersaline and brackish lakes, as well as \u001cbofedales\u001d and geothermal wetlands. These wetlands sustain such migratory birds as Phalaropus tricolor and Calidris bairdii, who use the wetlands as staging sites for roosting and feeding. The Horned Coot (Fulica corneta) and Darwin's Rhea (Rhea pennata garleppi), a very threatened subspecies, are also present. In addition, ca. 25% and 50% of the global population of the Andean flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and James's Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), respectively, concentrate in this area. There are also threatened non-avian species such as the endemic frog Telmatobius huayra, the Andean Mountain Cat Leopardus jacobita, and the colocolo Leopardus colocoloi. Due to its landscape beauty and natural attractions the site is the most visited protected area in Bolivia (ca. 70.000 tourist/year), which has caused negative impacts on the lakes. Mining represents another important threat. The Ramsar site covers two of the 14 priority sites of the Wetland Network of Importance for Conservation of High-Andes Flamingos in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Half of the Ramsar site is protected under the National Andean Wildlife Reserve Eduardo Avaroa. Added to the Montreux Record, 16 June 1993, removed from the Record, 7 August 1996.

The importance of this wetlands system is based on its function as habitat of endangered species such as the Antillean Manatee (Trichechus manatus), the Jabiru bird (Jabiru mycteria), the Guasa fish(Epinephelus itajara),the crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the sea turtle species Dermochelys coriacea and Eretmochelys imbricate. This Ramsar Site is also vital for aquatic species particularly during their early life stages as they maintain the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System fisheries and are the basis of the local economy. Furthermore, this wetlands system supports resident and migratory water bird populations as well as sea turtle populations that depend on the site’s beaches particularly during the spawning season. Apart from the ecosystem services already mentioned, this site is essential for the regulation of water flux and the prevention of seawater intrusion and contamination of aquifers in the coastal areas where local communities are located. Among the adverse effects faced by this Ramsar Site are the expansion of cattle ranching, the growing number of African Palm crops and the growing construction sector among others.

Covering part of the Paraná and Paraguay Rivers floodplain complex in the eastern border of Chaco province, limited to the north by the Bermejo River and surrounding the city of Resistencia. The hydrological regimes of each river give rise to different pulses of flood and drought in these wetlands, regulating floods downstream and retaining water in times of drought. The landscape is a complex of open water, aquatic vegetation, grasslands and gallery forests. Wildlife in these forests shares traits with that of the Humid Chaco and the Amazon region, and representative tree species are the \"Ibira-Pitá\" Peltophorum vogelianum, the \"Lapacho negro\" Tabebuia ipe, Nectandra falcifolia and Enterolobium contortosilquum. Several endangered species inhabit the site, including the Marsh Deer Blastocerus dichotomus, the Neotropical Otter Lutra longicaudis, the Bare-faced Curassow Crax fasciolata. Crocodilians (Caiman latirostris, C. crocodylus), the Coscoroba Swan Coscoroba coscoroba, and the endemic South American lungfish Lepidosiren paradoxa are also found. Economically important fish species are the Sorubims Pseudoplatystoma coruscans and P. fasciatum and Manguruyu Paulicea lutkeni. Cattle raising and rice crops are important activities, followed by soybean and sorghum. Hydrological changes have been noticeable since the 1960s, with dam building in the Upper Paraná in Brazil, deforestation, and increase in precipitation.

The site, characteristic of the estuarine systems found in northern Honduras, supports numerous threatened or endangered species such as the Antillean Manatee (Trichechus manatus) and the leatherback and Hawksbill sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea and Eretmochelys imbricata respectively), for which it provides nesting areas. It is rich in biodiversity and, to date, 59 species of plants, 34 of fish, 87 of birds (24 of which are migratory species), and 11 species of reptiles among others have been identified. In addition, the site supports numerous fish and crustacean species during their larval and juvenile stages, contributing to the maintenance of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef fisheries, and as it is located between two other Ramsar Sites (Parque Nacional Punta Izopo and Refugio de Vida Silvestre Cuero y Salado) it contributes to the creation of a Biological Corridor in northern Honduras. The area is also important for the Garifuna people, one of the nine ethnic groups present in Honduras, who depend on the site for their livelihoods. The main threats to the ecological character are related to deforestation of mangroves, expansion of African Palm crops, and population growth.  Ramsar Site no. 2189.

A flattish area with several surface depressions, ponds, and sinkholes that seasonally store surface water, located in the hilly countryside of central Jamaica. All of its wetland types have an important ecological function in preventing downstream flooding by absorbing precipitation. The site is a representative and rare example of an upland peat bog and scrub savannah. There are approximately 430 plant species found there, with 11% of endemism, some of which are listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, such as Bactris jamaicana, Calyptranthes nodosa, Cordia troyana and Hyeronima jamaicencis. The site also contains several species of the moss Sphagnum spp. which are essential for the existence of the bog. Likewise, it is also important for the endemic Mellisuga minima, the migratory species Oporomis agilis, and such carnivorous plants as the native Drosera capillaries, Urticularia spp., and Dionaea muscipula. It currently acts as an educational resource for students within the area and throughout Jamaica.

A lake and associated wetlands that is representative of the wetlands of the Gran Chaco, characterized by a flat area of woodland and scrub marsh with poor drainage. The expanse of open water of some 6,179 ha is surrounded by palm groves of Copernicia alba and the southern cattail Typha domingensis. The lake is one of the most significant bodies of water in the east of Santa Cruz province, particularly important for wintering migratory birds from both northern and southern hemispheres, as well as for large mammals. The area was formerly inhabited by indigenous people pursuing a nomadic hunting and gathering way of life, but presently it is occupied by private cattle ranchers and by indigenous people and campesinos practicing the same occupation. Over-grazing and over-hunting are among potential threats to the ecological character of the site. WWF-Bolivia and the Living Waters Programme have been instrumental in preparing this important site for designation. Ramsar site no. 1175.Most recent RIS information: 2002.</td>\n",

A part of the Güija complex is also representative of the Central America Dry Tropical Forest ecosystem, which is considered threatened by World Wildlife Fund (WWF). This ecosystem sustains IUCN Red List endangered species like the thorny iguana (Ctenosaura flavidorsalis) and species listed in appendices I and II of CITES as Amazonia albifrons, Puma yagoaroundi and A. auropalliata. The Site also records 59,000 water birds including migratory species such as Anas discors, Anas clypeata and Dendrocygna bicolor, and a high fish diversity that includes 14 native species from El Salvador. These natural resources support fishing at both commercial and subsistence levels as well as other main productive activities such as agriculture and tourism. Invasive species like water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) in some lagoons, the expansion of agricultural land, intentional burning, and water pollution due to the lack of sanitation system in the surrounding communities constitute the main threats for the Güija Complex.

It also supports a significant population of indigenous fish and at the same time is a source of food, a spawning site and a development area for those species of fish that depend upon the wetland. However, over-exploitation of water resources combined with the introduction of tilapia for fish-farming are resulting in a dramatic decline of the populations of indigenous species, not only in Abras, but in all coastal area watercourses. An assessment of the current state of the wetland is foreseen and should serve as a basis for development of a management plan for the area. Ramsar site no. 1023.

A large and important system of alluvial plains in the northeast of the country, with representative flooded amazon forests. The site hosts a huge biodiversity - some 87 mammal, 433 bird, 61 reptile, and 436 fish species have been identified. It hosts three species of crocodiles (Melanosuchus niger, Caiman yacare and Paleosuchus palpebrosus) and 16 migratory bird species like Pearl Kite Gampsonyx swainsonii, Osprey Pandion haliaetus, American Golden Plover Pluvialis dominica, and White-rumped Sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis. There are 22 threatened species of vertebrates, amongst them the Giant Otter Pteronura brasiliensis, Water Opossum Chironectes minimus, and Giant Armadillo Priodontes maximus. The site also hosts more than 1% of the total population of the Neotropic Cormorant Phalacrocorax brasilianus as well as of the Giant Otter. In the Iténez River sub-basin can be found 436 fish species, about 60% of all the species to be found in the Amazon basin.

This High Andean site (4,530m a.s.l.) is comparable to an oasis in the desert \u0013 although it is located in the deserted area of the Central Dry Puna of northern Chile, groundwater flows to the surface naturally, which allows the formation of saline lakes (salt pans) and azonal vegetation (meadows and bofedales) that sustain the regional wildlife. The site constitutes one of the most important wetlands for the conservation of high Andean flamingos (Andean, Chilean and James's), which are relatively abundant in the site (more than 1% of the global population, in all cases). It is also a staging area (feeding and roosting) for interhemispheric migratory birds, such as sandpipers, yellowlegs, and Wilson's Phalarope. In addition, the site stands out by the presence of large groups of austral vicuña (Vicugna vicugna vicugna), which graze in the meadows around the lake. The native communities Toconao and Talabre use the meadows and bofedales for grazing livestock (lamas and alpacas) and harvesting medicinal plants. Recently these communities, supported by the public sector, have started to take part in tourism activities in order to increase traditional household incomes. The Salar de Pujsa lies within the Atacama site, one of the 14 priority sites of the Wetland Network of Importance for Conservation of High-Andes Flamingos in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Part of the Ramsar site is protected under the National Reserve Los Flamencos. Ramsar site no. 1871. Most recent RIS information: 2009.</td>\n",

National Protected Area (partially). A large subtropical coastal wetland, with estuarine characteristics, predominance of mangroves, and many watercourses. It is located in the Samaná Bay, the largest semi-closed bay in the Caribbean, which contains a specific salinity gradient capable of supporting a great mosaic of habitats. It is also important by being part of karst systems and springs. The area supports species at risk of extinction, like Hypsiboas heilprini, Eleutherodactylus flavescens, and Eleutherodactylus schmidti, all of them endemic species. The site provides a refuge for seven endemic bird species: Dulus dominicus (Palmchat), Melanerpes striatus (Hispaniolan Woodpecker), Todus subulatus (Broad-billed Tody), Phaenicophilus palmarum (Black-crowned Palm-tanager), Coccyzus longirostris (Hispaniolan Lizard Cuckoo), Corvus palmarun (Palm Crow), and Icterus dominicensis (Hispaniolan Oriole). The site is closely related to the Samaná bay, an internationally important site for mating and reproduction of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae). Ramsar Site no. 2091.

They provide food, shelter, and breeding sites for many species of fish, some of which are migratory, and several species of birds, reptiles, and mammals facing some degree of threat. Some outstanding species are: the marsh seedeater (&lt;i&gt;Sporophila palustris&lt;/i&gt;), categorized as endangered in the IUCN Red List, and the rufous-rumped seedeater (&lt;i&gt;S. hypochroma&lt;/i&gt;), both included in Appendix I of CMS; and the jabiru (&lt;i&gt;Jabiru mycteria&lt;/i&gt;), the broad-snouted caiman (&lt;i&gt;Caiman latirostris&lt;/i&gt;), Geoffroy’s cat (&lt;i&gt;Leopardus geoffroyi&lt;/i&gt;), and the neotropical otter (&lt;i&gt;Lontra longicaudis&lt;/i&gt;), all of which are included in Appendix I of CITES.\\n\\nThe Site provides essential support to the livelihoods of the local communities. The river and smaller channels are used as commercial shipping routes and supply water for domestic and agricultural use, while the wetlands and their natural resources sustain tourism and recreational activities. Moreover, the ancient civilizations which occupied the floodplain and the Parana delta over two thousand years ago left a wealth of archaeological sites.</td>\n",

The Bañados lie at the termination of the river's course in a tectonic depression and are of great seasonal important as a source of water. As the only water source in a region of dry forest, during the dry season the site supplies vital support to at least four species of larger mammals (types of armadillo, panther, peccary, and tapir) which are listed by IUCN as vulnerable or endangered. Ecologically, because of its hydrological connection with the Amazon basin, the site serves as part of a biological and genetic corridor which permits the flow and interchange of species of the wetter north with those of arid zones of the south.

Located in the southeastern region of Brazil, the site is the largest vegetation fragmet of the endangered Atlantic Rain Forest in Minas Gerais State. In addition to permanent and seasonal rivers, there are 42 natural lakes that represent 6% of the park surface. The site hosts 10 different vegetation communities, 325 species of birds, and at least 77 of mammals. The endemic and threatened Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) can be found here, as well as other threatened species, such as jaguar (Panthera onca), Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), Red Billed Currasow (Crax blumenbachii) and North Muriqui, thelargest primate of South America and important seed disperser (Brachyteles hypoxanthus). One of the main threats is the introduction of exotic fish species that have led to changes in the fish community. Nevertheless, the site has a management plan that is being implemented.

It features different types of coastal wetland including permanent and temporary lagoons, vast mangroves, extensive sea grass beds and coral reefs. It is rich in biodiversity and supports threatened or endangered species such as the coral Acropora palmate, the Antillean manatee Trichechus manatus manatus, and the birds Dendrocygna arborea and Corvus leucognaphalus. The Site also supports the only known populations of the endemic Jaragua pupfish (Cyprinodon nichollsi) and is of utmost importance for the four species of sea turtle that nest and forage in the area. It has one of the largest populations in the world of juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and also supports populations of Dermochelys coriacea, Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta. The wetlands are also essential to the local economy which is based on artisan fishing, as they support species of high commercial value such as the lobster Panulirus argus and the queen conch Strombus gigas. The threats to the Site are associated with different economic activities; among these are the storage and transportation by land and sea of Bauxite, the movement and anchoring of boats and the development of tourism in the area.

A complex of wetlands located within the Los Nevados National Natural Park in the Central Andes of Colombia. It includes lagoons, swamps, peatlands interconnected or functionally related with one another and influenced by glaciers and páramo vegetation. The site is home to 52 species of birds, of which the most vulnerable are the aquatic species Oxyura jamaicensis andina and Podiceps occipitalis juninensis, with reduced populations and very localized distribution in Colombia \u0013 this makes them more susceptible to the degradation of their habitats, generated mainly by agricultural and livestock expansion. Other endangered bird species include Vultur gryphus, Hapalopsittaca fuertesi and Ognorhynchus icteriotis. Among the important flora species found in the site are Espeletia hartwegiana centroandina, Podocarpus oleifolius and Polylepis sericea, which are also found under special protection. In July 2006, the site suffered a fire that damaged more than 3,000 ha. A restoration plan is ongoing. Ramsar site no. 1781. Most recent RIS information: 2008.</td>\n",

Panama Bay is one of the most critical migration sites in the western hemisphere with an estimated presence of between one and two million shorebirds. The Site provides habitat for 14% of the global population of the western sandpiper (&lt;em&gt;Calidris mauri&lt;/em&gt;) with more than a million individuals, and over 30,000 semipalmated plover (&lt;em&gt;Charadrius semipalmatus&lt;/em&gt;) representing 20% of its global population. The Bay is lined with mangrove forests where at least seven mangrove species are found, two of which are classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List: &lt;em&gt;Avicennia bicolor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pelliciera rhizophorae&lt;/em&gt; (tea mangrove). The different ecosystems provide refuge and habitat to globally threatened and nationally protected plant and animal species, including great curassow (&lt;em&gt;Crax rubra&lt;/em&gt;), Geoffroy&amp;rsquo;s spider monkey (&lt;em&gt;Ateles geoffroyi&lt;/em&gt;), Baird&amp;rsquo;s tapir (&lt;em&gt;Tapirella bairdii&lt;/em&gt;), giant anteater (&lt;em&gt;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Annona spraguei&lt;/em&gt;, a tree endemic to Panama which is classified as vulnerable.

An extremely rich area in terms of its biodiversity, the site, on islands of recent volcanic formation, has a high number of endemic species, many of which are listed as vulnerable or endangered in the IUCN Red List: the Lava gull (Larus fuliginosus), for example, the Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) and Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus californianus wollebacki), the Green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Green sea urchin (Lytechinus semituberculatus), the marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) and the sea cucumber (Stichopus fuscus). Moreover, the site sustains more than 22.5% of the endemic subspecies Galapagos flamingo and significant proportions of a number of native fish species. Nearly all of the site falls within the Parque Nacional Galápagos, and human uses include tourism, non-commercial fishing among the local population, and the raising of such introduced mammals as goats, pigs, and cattle. The potential proliferation of introduced species, particularly of rats, cats, the African kikuyu grasss, and the invasive tree frog Scinax quinquefasciata since 1998 (the first amphibians in the islands), is noted as a cause for concern.

The site is distinguished because of its unparalleled scenic beauty, its archaeological remains of ancient Andean cultures, and its highly vulnerable endemic flora. Additionally, it has been identified as a key bird conservation area within Ecuador, as well as an important transit point for migratory species. Notable vulnerable species in the site include spectacled (Andean) bears (Tramarctos ornatus), Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), as well as threatened plant species Podocarpus spucey and Polylepis sp.

A brackish coastal lagoon representative of wetlands in central Chile, where the wildlife of the Atacama-Sechura Desert and Chilean Matorral ecoregions meet, a key staging area for migratory birds along the central Chilean coast. A creek feeds freshwater to the lagoon, and during periods of high rainfall, the barrier island is flooded and the lagoon becomes an estuary. Saltmarshes are mainly composed of coastal salt grass (Distichlis spicata), alkali seaheath (Frankenia salina), and Sarcocornia peruviana. There are coastal dunes, coastal shrub-steppe vegetation, and coastal Mediterranean shrub, the latter of high conservation priority. The Coscoroba Swan Coscoroba coscoroba, White-faced Ibis Plegadis chihi, endemic Chilean Mockingbird Mimus thenca, and Tropidurid lizard Liolaemus zapallarensis are noteworthy species of the site. Five endemic fish species are found, including Odontesthes brevianalis and Mugil sp. The Pelambres copper mining company purchased the area in 1997, and the site was cleaned, fenced and is undergoing a restoration process. Footpaths, observatories and information panels have been placed to attract ecotourism and carry out environmental education. The mining port nearby has a contingency plan in place to avoid impacts on the site and there are no major threats currently affecting the area. The University of Chile is carrying out a monitoring and management plan. Ramsar Site no. 1374. Most recent RIS information: 2004.</td>\n",

The Reserve provides important ecosystem services, for example providing water, food, and recreational and aesthetic resources, regulating floods and erosion, and maintaining groundwater levels. It also supports numerous ecological communities such as &lt;em&gt;vegas&lt;/em&gt; (alluvial plains), the most characteristic wetlands of the Site. The Reserve covers a wide altitude range, from 700 to 3,300 metres above sea level, and so it harbours numerous notable species such as the endangered Andean cat &lt;em&gt;Leopardus jacobita&lt;/em&gt; and the endemic Burmeister&amp;#39;s anole&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pristidactylus scapulatus&lt;/em&gt;.

The island is of volcanic origin and its highest point is 634 m above sea level with 7,000 mm of rainfall per year. There are two plant associations, one the evergreen forest with South American similarity, on the hilly areas, and a coastal one (dominated by a sedge Hypolitum amplum). It is considered to be one of the areas of highest endemism in the country, with five endemic vertebrate species and 16% of the plant species. Surrounding the island there are coral reefs, with 18 species and more than 300 fish species, which in some areas reach concentrations of 1,500-24,000 individuals/km2. A shelter for pirates during the 17th and 18th century. The site includes a swampy, coastal zone, a cloud forest and mountainous areas. The area is important for the reproduction of certain species, and large numbers of waterbirds nest in the area. The primary tourist activity is diving. Ramsar site no. 940.

Located in the northern part of Peru, this wetland is the last mangrove relict of the southern pacific of South America and is composed by two mangrove species Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa, as well as 43 species of Phanerogamous plants. This site is part of the coastal wetland corridor for migratory birds, registering 98 species of resident and migratory waterfowl. The mangrove is habitat to many fish species, reptiles, invertebrates and micro fauna, and some mammal species such as Pseudalopex sechurae, Didelphys marsupialis and Conepatus semistriatus can also be spotted in the site. It is also of great social and economic importance for the inhabitants of the area, undertaking activities such as subsistence fishing and extraction of crustaceans and mollusks. Sadly, this wetland is currently threatened due to an inadequate management and lack of planning. Every year thousands of tourists visit the site, leaving their trash behind, which accumulates and creates not only a visual impact but affects the wildlife living in it. There is a strong relation between the dry forest, the mangroves and the coastal desert, which are important for mammals and birds.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. 22/04/98; Belize, Orange Walk; 6,637 ha; 17°44'N 088°29'W. Wildlife Sanctuary. A subtropical freshwater complex comprising a network of shallow lagoons, streams, creeks, and marshes. The larger of the two included areas centers upon the island village of Crooked Tree (ca.180 households), founded as a logging camp ca.1750, one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in Belize; a secondary group of wetlands, including Jones and Mexico Lagoons, lies on the far side of the Northern Highway a kilometre to the east. The area provides critical habitat for wildlife, particularly migratory and local birds, and the shallow water system is especially important for wading species. A number of Mayan archaeological sites are found in the area. Villagers practice subsistence farming, livestock raising, fishing, logging, and charcoal production, and the area is well-known for its cashew products, especially wine. Development to the northeast raises the possibility of habitat fragmentation and pollution. The Sanctuary is managed on behalf of the Government by the Belize Audobon Society. Ramsar site no. 946.

The site hosts the critically endangered species leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricate), elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), and the endemic Grenada Hook-billed Kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus mirus), which depends on forest habitats, including wooded freshwater swamps, and mangrove swamps. It is of particular significance as a nesting of Dermochelys coriacea, receiving from 200 to 900 nesting activities annually, supporting at least 1% of the individuals of this species. The major human-induced pressures on the ecological values of the LPPA include: Fishing activities which impact populations of fish and non-target species; Improper solid waste disposal; Predation or competition from introduced species; and Alteration of marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

A salt high Andean lake in the Puna at 4,300m altitude, Laguna de Salinas lies at the bottom of an endorrheic basin with geothermal activities amidst snow-capped mountains and volcanoes. Open peat bogs known as bofedales surround the lake, providing an important grazing area for native camelids such as vicuñas and llamas as well as habitat for the endemic pupfish Orestias agassizii. Chilean (Phoenicopterus chilensis), James's (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), and the endangered Andean flamingoes (Phoenicoparrus andinus) inhabit the lake, reaching over 20,000 during the rainy season. Calidris spp sandpipers also winter in large numbers. Salt and borate mining is an important economic activity in the lake itself but also the main concern for the site due to the necessary soil removal of its operations. The impacts of overgrazing, the traditional activities of picking duck's eggs, and trout culture are being addressed through a Management Plan of the Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve, to which the Ramsar site belongs.

The Site contains an area representative of the mangroves of the dry Northern Pacific ecoregion of Central America and a palm tree (Brahea salvadorensis) swamp representative of an ecosystem specific to the Mesoamerican dry tropical forest ecoregion. It supports numerous threatened or endangered species. Among these are four species of marine turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea, Dermochelys coriacea and Chelonia mydas) and other species severely threatened by their commercial trade value, such as the yellow-naped parrot (Amazona auropalliata). The mangroves also support about 75% of the commercially important coastal fauna in El Salvador. Many of these species, such as the shrimp of the Penaeidae family, depend on the mangroves as feeding, spawning and nursery areas. The Site is important for local communities as they depend on artisanal fishing for their livelihoods. It is threatened by unregulated urbanization, overgrazing, the growth of sugar cane and the increasing demand of wood for construction, as these have caused deforestation, changes in the hydrology of the area and pollution.

It is a crucial ecological connector between the rural and urban territories of the Bogot&amp;aacute; River basin, crossing the city of Bogot&amp;aacute; from east to west. In addition, it is the first urban complex of High Andean wetlands in Latin America to be added to the List. The site has also been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA).

The site contains an extraordinary diversity of both permanent and seasonal wetland types, with abundant lakes and remnant islands. Some 9 species of fauna from CITES Appendix I are supported, as well as 70 from Appendix II, and 17 species found in IUCN's Red List are present. Parts of the site near the river Urituyacu are particularly important for the palms Phytelephas tenuicaulis and Aphandra natalia, and the Pastaza supports a large population of the palm Elaeis oleifera, seen only a few places elsewhere in Peru. Nearly 300 species of fish have been recorded. Human occupation, largely restricted to the banks of the principal rivers, is a low-density mix of indigenous and settler communities who cultivate banana, cassava, and maize. Studies of the area by WWF Perú and the Centro de Datos para la Conservación of the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina facilitated the preparation of the site's designation. Ramsar site no. 1174.

Lake Titicaca, in the Central Andes, is the world's highest navigable freshwater lake, at 3810 m above sea level, shared between Peru and Bolivia. The wetland is a permanent freshwater lake, with associated marshes and extensive areas of emergent aquatic vegetation. There are a number of endemic fish species present and the site is extremely important for migratory shorebirds and Andean waterbirds, including three species of flamingo. Algae and submergent and floating vegetation is abundant, and the dominant emergent species is the \"totora\" Schoenoplectus tatora, which can reach up to seven meters. When the \"totora\" drifts away from the shore, it forms islands which are used by some members of the Uro community to live on. Most of them are fishermen and hunters, but they also make crafts to sell. Whilst subsistence fishing is the main use of the lake by the local communities, the surrounding areas are used for agriculture. Ramsar site no. 881. Most recent RIS information: 1996.</td>\n",

Includes more than ten Andean highland lagoons that occupy endorrheic depressions in the extreme northwest of the country at 4,500 meters above sea level. The lagoons have diverse characteristics, from saline and deep to hypersaline and shallow. They provide habitat for a very rich aquatic bird life, with a good number of endemic and/or endangered species (flamingos Phoenicoparrus andinus, P. jamesi, and coots Fulica cornuta); in addition, a diversity of Nearctic migrating species find a feeding place here. In the plains that surround the lagoons, locally called \"ciénegos\", other endangered species like vicuñas and \"ñandú\" (South American ostrich; Pterocnemia pennata garleppi) are present. These \"ciénegos\" also provide grazing resources for herds of domestic camelids (llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, etc.) and sheep of the local people who practice traditional modes of transhumance. In addition to these plains, the most prevalent vegetation are characteristic of shrub steppes and Andean highland pastures. Numerous archeological sites attest to significant human populations from 5,000 years ago, and the lagoons continue to hold ritual significance.

The Damani-Guariviara wetland lies within the Neotropical-Caribbean biogeographical region and includes coastal and inland wetlands such as beaches, marshes, salty and freshwater lagoons, rivers and mangroves. Because of its various habitats, the site has high biological value as it sustains an ample diversity of flora and fauna. The area is an important nesting site for turtles such as the critically endangered Carey (Eretmochelys imbricata) and it sustains species in CITES' appendices I and II and IUCN Red List such as Manatee (Trichechus manatus), Howling monkeys (Aloutta palliata), Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), and Green turtle (Chelonia mydas). The area also provides livelihoods for the nomad Ngobe y Buglé ethnic groups, among Panama's most ancient tribes, and it is considered to have high ethno- and eco-touristic potential. Among its main threats, the wetland faces deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, subsistence hunting, overexploitation of marine resources, mining, and pollution of its catchment. In response, a management plan has been proposed for the site. The site was designated a national protected area in 2004 under the category Wetland of International Importance. Ramsar site no. 1907.

The site fulfils all eight of the Ramsar Criteria and is considered one of the most important wetlands in Argentina and in the Chaco ecoregion in terms of the richness of its biodiversity in a range from freshwater to very saline. A number of species meet the waterbird Criteria, including Egretta thula (400,000 individuals), Phalaropus tricolor (200,000), Phalacrocorax olivaceus (42,000), Bubulcus ibis (60,000), and Plegadis chihi (400,000), and at least 4 species above the 1% threshold. Some 27 species of fish are known to breed in the site. Livestock raising and fishing are principal land uses, with some forestry and agriculture.
